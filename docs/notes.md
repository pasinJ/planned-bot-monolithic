## Base asset vs. Quote asset
> A currency pair is a quotation of two different currencies, where one is quoted against the other. The first listed currency within a currency pair is called the **base**, while the second currency that is the benchmark is called the **quote**.<br/>
> Currency pairs are meant to be compared against one another in order to understand <u>how much of the quote currency is required to buy one unit of the base currency.</u><br/>

## Volume vs. Quote volume
**Volume** indicates the total amount of **base asset** that has been bought and sold in the period of the kline.<br/>
**Quote volume** indicates the total amount of **quote asset** that has been bought and sold in the period of the kline.

## Maker vs. Taker
A **Maker** is a group of people who set a specific price (Limit Order) in the order book for both buyers and sellers.<br/>
A **taker** is a group of people who buy or sell at market prices (Market Order.)  They may as well send in a limit order, but the price offered is better than the market price at the moment.
